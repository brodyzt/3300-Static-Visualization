                Inherent issues in society are often mirrored in said society's contemporary media. Due to this fact,
                taking a more detailed and in depth look into media can illustrate these prevalent patterns. In this
                data visualization, we seek to illustrate the differences in various factors between movies that pass
                and fail the Bechdel Test, a test that evaluates whether or not the movie in question contains an
                instance of two women talking about something other than men, viewing the data at different angles to
                reveal patterns and trends that illuminate how American society viewed women in the past decades.

                The following graphs demonstrate that there is been some improvement in female representation in
                movies; however, they also provide evidence that there is still much more to be done to close the
                gender gap in the American film industry.

            <p>
                There are multiple ways of failing the Bechdel test. This graph identifies the percentage
                of movies that failed the Bechdel test each year and the different colors represent the various
                categories of failure. The categories of failure are as follows. "No Women" means there were no
                significant female roles. "No W2W" means there wasn't any communication between two female characters.
                "Only Talk About Men" means female characters talked to each other, but only about the subject of men.
                "Disagreement" means that the reviewers for these movies didn't agree 100% on the movies in that
                category.
            </p>
            <p>
                As
                seen by the total height of the bars, the overall trend is movies are
                failing less frequently as time goes on. Another notable trend is that there are substantially less No
                W2W
                failures now than in 1970.

            <h2 class="mdc-typography--headline2 graphHeader">Avg. Rating vs. Year</h2>
            <p>
                This graph illustrates the progression of movies that pass and fail the Bechdel Test over the last
                thirty-five years in relation to their average IMDB rating. For each year, movies were split into two
                groups based on whether they passed or failed the Bechdel test. Then, the average IMDB rating was
                calculated
                for both of these groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                While there is some variation year to year,
                it appears that generally, movies that passes the Bechdel test in the 1980s rated significantly lower
                than those that failed. The average ratings of the movies that passed and those that failed, however,
                has almost converged within the last 20 years. There is still a small discrepancy, but not nearly as
                much as 30 years ago.

                Budgets are a very good indication of how much trust and investment that a movie has. In this
                visualization, movies from more than 30 years are graphed in relation to their budget and
                marked as passing the Bechdel Test (blue) or failing (red).
            </p>
            <p>
                The graph seeks to illustrate the differences in backing these two groups of movies got, and observe
                how this trend has evolved and changed through the last few decades of American Media. Although,
                the number of movies passing and failing the test seem relatively equal, the better funded movies have
                been
                failing the Bechdel test. This is evident in the abundance of more of red color circles at higher scale
                budgets
                relative to blue ones.
