                Inherent issues in society are often mirrored in said society's contemporary media. Due to this fact,
                taking a more detailed and in depth look into media can illustrate these prevalent patterns. In this
                data visualization, we seek to illustrate the differences in various factors between movies that pass
                and fail the Bechdel Test, a test that evaluates whether or not the movie in question contains an
                instance of two women talking about something other than men, viewing the data at different angles to
                reveal patterns and trends that illuminate how American society viewed women in the past decades.

                The Bechdel test has multiple categories of movies that can fail. This graph shoes the trend in each of
                these categories over time. The categories of failure are as follows. "No Women" means there were no
                significant female roles. "No W2W" means there wasn't any communication between two female characters.
                "Only Talk About Men" means female characters talked to each other, but only about the subject of men.
                "Disagreement" means that the reviewers for these movies didn't agree 100% on the movies in that
                category. As
                seen by the total height of the bars, the overall trend is movies are
                failing less frequently as time goes on. Another notable trend is that there are substantially less No
                W2W
                failures now than in 1970.

                This graph illustrates the progression of movies that pass and fail the Bechdel Test over the last
                thirty-five years in relation to their average IMDB rating. While there is some variation year to year,
                it appears that generally, movies that passes the Bechdel test in the 1980s rated significantly lower
                than those that failed. The average ratings of the movies that passed and those that failed, however,
                has almost converged within the last 20 years. There is still a small discrepancy, but not nearly as
                much as 30 years ago.
