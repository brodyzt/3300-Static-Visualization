                    Inherent issues in society are often mirrored in said society's contemporary media. Due to this fact,
                    taking a more detailed and in depth look into media can illustrate these prevalent patterns. In this
                    data visualization, we seek to illustrate the differences in various factors between movies that pass
                    and fail the Bechdel Test, a test that evaluates whether or not the movie in question contains an
                    instance of two women talking about something other than men, viewing the data at different angles to
                    reveal patterns and trends that illuminate how American society viewed women in the past decades.
